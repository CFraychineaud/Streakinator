Streakinator is a GitHub automation tool that updates a `.txt` file in your repository with the current date and time every 24 hours. It automates commits and pushes to keep your Boot.Dev study streak alive.

> **‚ö† Important Note:**  
> If you're new to programming and trying to build the habit of coding regularly, you should **NOT** use this tool!  
>  
> Consistency and personal effort are key to developing programming skills, and relying on automation defeats the purpose of building healthy habits.  
>  
> This tool is not meant for cheating‚Äîit's meant for those who already know what they‚Äôre doing but are too lazy to worry about keeping their streak up every day.
